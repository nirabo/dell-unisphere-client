## Overview

The Dell Unisphere Client testing strategy aims to ensure that the CLI tool meets all functional and non-functional requirements while providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly interface to the Dell Unisphere REST API. Testing will cover all aspects of the application, from individual components to the entire system, with a focus on both automated and manual testing approaches.

## Test Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests will focus on testing individual components in isolation, ensuring that each function and class behaves as expected.

#### Scope

- CLI command parsing and validation
- API client methods
- Data model validation
- Configuration management
- Authentication handling

#### Approach

- Use pytest as the primary testing framework
- Implement test cases for each function and class
- Use mocking to isolate components from external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage (target: >90%)

#### Example Test Cases

| ID | Component | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| UT-001 | cli.py | Test command parsing for `version` command | Command correctly parsed and routed to handler |
| UT-002 | client.py | Test authentication with valid credentials | Authentication successful, token returned |
| UT-003 | client.py | Test authentication with invalid credentials | Authentication fails with appropriate error |
| UT-004 | models.py | Test validation of SoftwareVersion model | Valid data passes, invalid data raises validation error |
| UT-005 | version.py | Test version retrieval | Correct version string returned |

### Integration Testing

Integration tests will verify that different components work together correctly, focusing on the interfaces between components.

#### Scope

- CLI to business logic integration
- Business logic to API client integration
- API client to mock Unisphere API integration

#### Approach

- Test interactions between components
- Use mock servers to simulate the Unisphere API
- Focus on data flow and error handling between components

#### Example Test Cases

| ID | Integration Point | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| IT-001 | CLI to Client | Test login command end-to-end | CLI calls client with correct parameters, handles response |
| IT-002 | Client to API | Test software version retrieval | Client formats request correctly, processes API response |
| IT-003 | Client to API | Test error handling for API failures | Client properly handles and reports API errors |
| IT-004 | CLI to Config | Test configuration storage and retrieval | Config values stored and retrieved correctly |
| IT-005 | Client to Models | Test data mapping from API to models | API responses correctly mapped to model objects |

### System Testing

System tests will evaluate the entire application as a whole, ensuring that all components work together to meet the requirements.

#### Scope

- End-to-end workflows
- Command-line interface behavior
- Error handling and recovery
- Configuration and state management

#### Approach

- Test complete user workflows
- Use a mock Unisphere API server
