# Client Frontend Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement a frontend client that provides equivalent functionality to the curl-based backend usage demonstrated in test_upgrade_flow.sh and test_upgrade_flow_report.md.

## Current Backend Workflow
Based on the curl scripts, the backend workflow includes:
1. Authentication
2. Version checking
3. Upgrade verification
4. Upgrade session creation
5. Status monitoring
6. Logout

## Frontend Implementation Strategy

### 1. Authentication Module
- Implement login functionality using the existing client API
- Store session tokens securely
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

### 2. Version Checking
- Create a version check command that:
  - Retrieves current software version
  - Lists available upgrade candidates
  - Displays version information in a user-friendly format

### 3. Upgrade Verification
- Implement verify_upgrade command that:
  - Takes target version as input
  - Checks system compatibility
  - Returns verification results with clear status messages

### 4. Upgrade Session Management
- Create upgrade session command that:
  - Initiates upgrade process
  - Returns session ID for tracking
  - Provides real-time status updates

### 5. Status Monitoring
- Implement status command that:
  - Takes session ID as input
  - Provides detailed progress information
  - Updates status at regular intervals

### 6. Logout
- Implement secure logout functionality that:
  - Invalidates session tokens
  - Cleans up session data
  - Provides confirmation of successful logout

## Implementation Timeline
1. Week 1: Authentication and Version Checking
2. Week 2: Upgrade Verification and Session Management
3. Week 3: Status Monitoring and Logout
4. Week 4: Testing and Documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each command
- Integration tests for complete workflow
- End-to-end tests matching curl-based scenarios

## Documentation Requirements
- User guide for CLI commands
- API reference documentation
- Error handling guidelines
- Security best practices

## Dependencies
- Existing client API
- Authentication service
- Version management service
- Upgrade verification service
