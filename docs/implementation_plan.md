# Client Frontend Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement a frontend client that provides equivalent functionality to the curl-based backend usage demonstrated in test_upgrade_flow.sh and test_upgrade_flow_report.md.

## Current Backend Workflow
Based on the curl scripts, the backend workflow includes:
1. Authentication
2. Version checking
3. Upgrade verification
4. Upgrade session creation
5. Status monitoring
6. Logout

## Frontend Implementation Strategy

### 1. Authentication Module
- Implement login functionality using the existing client API
- Store session tokens securely
- Handle authentication errors gracefully
- Implement session caching in ~/.uniclient/session_<timestamped_id> files
- Add session validation and timeout handling

### 2. Session Management
- Implement session file handling:
  * Create session files with 600 permissions
  * Store session data (timeout, CSRF token, cookie, credentials)
  * Handle session file corruption
  * Implement session reuse logic
- Add session timeout validation for all operations
- Implement session cleanup on logout

### 3. Version Checking
- Create a version check command that:
  - Retrieves current software version
  - Lists available upgrade candidates
  - Displays version information in a user-friendly format
  - Validates session timeout before execution

### 4. Upgrade Verification
- Implement verify_upgrade command that:
  - Takes target version as input
  - Checks system compatibility
  - Returns verification results with clear status messages
  - Validates session timeout before execution

### 5. Upgrade Session Management
- Create upgrade session command that:
  - Initiates upgrade process
  - Returns session ID for tracking
  - Provides real-time status updates
  - Validates session timeout before execution

### 6. Status Monitoring
- Implement status command that:
  - Takes session ID as input
  - Provides detailed progress information
  - Updates status at regular intervals
  - Validates session timeout before execution

### 7. Logout
- Implement secure logout functionality that:
  - Invalidates session tokens
  - Deletes session files
  - Provides confirmation of successful logout

## Implementation Timeline
1. Week 1: Authentication and Session Management
2. Week 2: Version Checking and Upgrade Verification
3. Week 3: Upgrade Session Management and Status Monitoring
4. Week 4: Logout, Testing and Documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each command
- Integration tests for complete workflow
- End-to-end tests matching curl-based scenarios
- Session management tests:
  * Session file creation and validation
  * Session timeout handling
  * Session reuse scenarios
  * Session file corruption handling

## Documentation Requirements
- User guide for CLI commands
- API reference documentation
- Error handling guidelines
- Security best practices
- Session management documentation:
  * Session file format
  * Session timeout behavior
  * Session reuse scenarios

## Dependencies
- Existing client API
- Authentication service
- Version management service
- Upgrade verification service
- File system access for session management
